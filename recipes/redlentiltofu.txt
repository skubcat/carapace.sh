Red Lentil tofu

3/4 cup red lentils
1/2 cup boiling water
2 cups room temp water
1 tsp salt (optional)

Combine 1/2 cup boiling water and 3/4 cup red lentils in a bowl.
Let stand 15-20 minutes.
Blend the lentil water mixture until completely smooth.
Pour the mixture into a saucepan. Whisk in 2 cups water for normal firmness, 1/2 cup for extra firm tofu. (Add the salt here if you want it.)
Mix for 6-8 mins on med-high, you can turn down the heat as it gets thicker.
Scoop into a square glass, or ceramic baking dish, while smoothing and flattening the top.
Refrigerate for an hour. Up to 8 hours, overnight. Lasts about 5 days.
